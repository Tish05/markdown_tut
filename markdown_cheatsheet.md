# 1- Headings 
How to write headings in markdown file?
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

# 2 - Block of words
This is a normal text in Markdown

> This is a block of special text

To make an special text or distinct block, you have to use ">" sign before typing the line!
> it's the 2nd line

huh! you have to press "enter" two times to put the sentence on the 2nd line :)

# 3 - Line breaks
You can also use the full stop sign and the reverse "\" then press enter to separate the lines-.\
This is the 2nd example!

# 4 - Combining two things
Block of words and headings

>## Heading 2

# 5 - Face of texts

**Bold**


*Italic*


***Bold & Italic***

or you can use "underscore"

__Bold__

_Italic_

# 6 - Bullet points/ Lists
Type "-" and space for making bullets, for example -

- Fruits
- Vegetables
- Beans
- Rice

Press "tab" and  for making sub-bullets, for example -
- Fruits
- Vegetables
- Beans
- Rice
    - Per boiled rice
    - Hard rice
- Legumes
- Lentins

# 7 - Numbering of lists

1. Pens
2. Pencils
3. Books
4. Socks
    -   4a. reds
    -   4b. blues
5. Tables
6. Tomtoms

Then, use "*" or "#" for numbering , for example-
+ Pool
+ Swiming suits

# 8 - Page/Line breaks

You can use '-' or '_' or '*' 3 times to make a line in between two sentences!

This page 1.
___
This is page 2.

# 9 - Links & Hyperlinks
type '<>' to your desired website link into your file, i.e,-
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJqAXjz-Rh4&list=PL9XvIvvVL50HVsu-Ao8NBr0UJSO8O6lBI&index=24>

To put 'click here' option to access any link, use third bracket [ ] for 'featuring sentence' and put the link after that into a 1st bracket ( ), for example-

[click here to see the playlist!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJqAXjz-Rh4&list=PL9XvIvvVL50HVsu-Ao8NBr0UJSO8O6lBI&index=24)

Another way to make this happen, is like this- just make one word for the link, see left for the code used for it ;)

# 10 - Images & Figures with link
---

![QR](qr.png)

---
If you want add an online image file, then you have to copy the image link to paste in your coding file

![codanics](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqJqAXjz-Rh4&psig=AOvVaw3O06Vpku9IUnz6xAow4Lp5&ust=1646608051316000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAwQjhxqFwoTCPiJ-ayLsPYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)


# 11 - Adding codes or a code block

Adding a back tick sign will do the trick! for example-

>print ("Hello, Sam")

this looks normal, right?

>but if add a back tick before and after the whole code, then  it will change the color!

`print ("Hello, Sam")`

>To make a block of codes add 3 ``` sign, i.e-

```            
```

>you can put your whole code inside this black block! such as-

``` x= a+b
    y= c+d
    z= x*y
    print (z)
```
> You can also use specific language like R or Python or HTML in this type blocks, i,e.-

```python
 x= a+b
 y= c+d
 z= x*y
print(z)
```
```R
 x= a+b
 y= c+d
 z= x*y
print(z)
```
>Such type of coding will also show the change in color! interesting right?

# 12 - Adding tables

> add '|' and dashes to make rows and columns, for example-

| item | number| size |
|-----|-----|-----|
| pen  |   11  | 1.5 |
| pencil  |   5  | 0.05 |
| straw   |   15  | 1.05 |

>To align the table, add ':' after and before the dashes-for middle alignment --

| item | number| size |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| pen  |   11  | 1.5 |
| pencil  |   5  | 0.05 |
| straw   |   15  | 1.05 |

# 13 - Contents

>use [ ]  and (#) to make a content list for your file or page! 
After ading #..the markdown extension will help you choose from all the hashtags you used in the whole document or file, i.e.-

[1- Headings](#1--headings)

[2- Contents](#13---contents)

[3- Tables](#12---adding-tables)

[4- Extensions](#14---installing-extensions)
